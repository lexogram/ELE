when I was a child, there were two things that terrified me. One was to look up into space and realize that I am just a tiny, tiny, infinitessimally tiny dot of consciousness in a unimaginably huge universe. And the Lady of the Green Girtle, in a story called The Silver Chair, the fourth of the Narnia Chronicles.

Prince Rillian has been captured by a beautiful witch, and is imprisened in the Underworld — a dark labyrinth of tunnels deep under the ground. The witch has cast a spell on him, so that he has forgotten everything about his past, and he believes that she is the kindest, most loving woman possible, and that the Underworld is all that exists. Then two children find their way into the Underworld, discover Prince Rillian, and break the spell, so he remembers everything... which spoils the beautiful witch's plans. When she finds them all together, she starts to create a new spell, playing on a mandolin, and tries to convince Prince Rillian that his memories of the Overworld — the grass, the trees, the sky, the sun — all this is just a dream.

Let me read an edited version to you:

  "What is this sun that you all speak of? Can you tell me what it's like?" asked the Witch (thrum, thrum, thrum, went the strings of her magic mandolin).

  "Please it your Grace," said the Prince, very coldly and politely. "You see that lamp. It is round and yellow and it hangs from the roof and gives light to the whole room. Now that thing which we call the sun is like the lamp, only far greater and brighter. It gives light to the whole Overworld and hangs in the sky."

  "Hangs from what, my lord?" asked the Witch; and then she added, with another of her soft, silver laughs: "You see? When you try to think out clearly what this sun must be, you cannot tell me. You can only tell me it is like the lamp. Your sun is a dream; and there is nothing in that dream that was not copied from the lamp. The lamp is the real thing; the sun is but a tale, a children's story."

  "Yes, I see now," said the Prince in a heavy, hopeless tone. "It must be so."

How this terrified me at the age of 10! The thought that there is no way to describe anything except by comparing it to something else. That every word only has a meaning in relation to other words that have different meanings. That meaning doesn't live in words, but in the tensions and pressures that other words apply to them.

Have you ever said the same word over and over and over again, until it becomes meaningless, just a sound?

The words "sun" and "lamp" — if you look at each word by itself, its meaning vanishes. 

One thing I love about learning Russian, is that the metaphors you use, the pressures and tensions between words, are all different. The mind map that you use to create meanings is different from English. Having two mind maps that overlap makes the gaps what I can say and understand smaller, and finer, and safer.

We think in metaphors.

No: the only way we can express our thoughts is through metaphors.

Conscious thoughts occupy a very small part of our brain and nervous system. Our heart beats, our gut digests, our lungs pump without our thinking about it.

And our brains deceive us. Here's a test for you. Take out your smartphones and Google for "reaction time test". The first hit should be:

reaction time test
https://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime/

Go ahead: take the test. Tap the screen to start: the screen will go red. Hold your finger as close to the screen as possible without actually touching it. When the screen goes green, tap immediately. Or not so immediately. My best time is 284 milliseconds.

Who got the lowest score?

Let's say 250 milliseconds, a quarter of a second, or 1/240th of a minute. What does 250 milliseconds sound like?

It's a considerable chunk of time. You can clap faster than 4 times a second. Yes?

Why does it take so long? Your brain sees the change in colour, does some processing, and sends a signal to your finger to move. The signal is sent by electrical impulses. It takes about 200 milliseconds for the signal to travel from your brain to your finger.

Now touch the tip of your nose with the tip of your index finger.

Did you feel it? The neural path from your nose to your brain is much shorter than the path from your finger to your brain. The signal telling your brain that your finger touched your nose arrives about 200 milliseconds after the signal that says that your nose was touched by your finger.

Tk - tk.

Did you feel it? Did you feel the two signals arriving at different times?

No. Your brain deceives you. It receives the signals at different times, but it tells you — the conscious you — about the signals only after it has received both.

You can't trust your brain.
