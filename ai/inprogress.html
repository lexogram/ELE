        <p>"What is this sun that you all speak of? Can you tell me what it's like?" asked the Witch (thrum, thrum, thrum, went the strings of her magic mandolin).</p>
        <p>"Please it your Grace," said the Prince, very coldly and politely. "You see that lamp. It is round and yellow and it hangs from the roof and gives light to the whole room. Now that thing which we call the sun is like the lamp, only far greater and brighter. It gives light to the whole Overworld and hangs in the sky."</p>
        <p>"Hangs from what, my lord?" asked the Witch; and then she added, with another of her soft, silver laughs: "You see? When you try to think out clearly what this sun must be, you cannot tell me. You can only tell me it is like the lamp. Your sun is a dream; and there is nothing in that dream that was not copied from the lamp. The lamp is the real thing; the sun is but a tale, a children's story."</p>
        <p> "Yes, I see now," said the Prince in a heavy, hopeless tone. "It must be so."</p>
